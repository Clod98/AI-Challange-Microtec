# AI-Challange-Microtec
Some of the files/programs we used in order to accomplish our task

1) The first prgram to be read is "joinFileProgram", it creates a dataset with all the boards, keeping the most important data: log-id, board-id and IP_MOR index
2) The second program is read: it creates a dataset with all the logs data: density, eccentricty, ecc...
3) The third one is "merge": it joins the two previous datasets in a datset called "final"
4) Forth one is "lastJoin": it joins the previous datasets with the infos about coordinates of the boards in the respective logs.
5) "FinalAnalysis": an R program with the insights we got from our study.
